# GROUP PROJECT

---
### Description

__What the project is about in a couple of sentences__

Application that allows parents to subscribe their kids to daycare activities in a simple way, and allows the school to organize the process of subscription to such activities.


__What problem are we trying to solve__

Lack of organization in the process of subscribing kids to the daycare activities:
- the school has to manually process the data, receiving many calls and emails;
- parents’ don’t see availability in the calendar;
- the parents have to either spend time on the telephone or send an email without knowing whether the child was actually subscribed;
- language barrier between parents and teachers.
