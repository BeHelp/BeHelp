## General info

When a newcomer arrives in Belgium, he/she may face a need for various services and have a problem with a language barrier and/or lack of financial resources to afford such services. We will create an application that gathers information about organizations and volunteers ready to help with providing the following services:

- translation
- legal advice
- psychotherapists/coaches
- host families for refugees
- education services (language classes, etc.)
- social assistance (medical assistance, services)

The application will include the search tool that will filter organization/services by service, geographical region, type of service provider (organization/volunteer), language. It will also include the tool to contact the chosen volunteer via the website and give information on how to contact the organization.
